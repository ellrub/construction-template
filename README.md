# Bergen & Omegn Entrepren√∏r AS

## Overview
This was originally intended as a template for more websites, hence the name of the repo, but i underestimated the amount of work required to get clients, so i had to give it up in favour of more learning. In hindsight it might have been the best way to continue learning...

This landing page was made for a local contactor that specializes in groundwork.
It's a fairly simple landing page that showcases what services the contractor offers, some info about them, as well as how to contact them.
